Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however important for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.

/Users/s2820577/miniforge3/envs/snakemake/lib/python3.12/site-packages/conda/base/context.py:201: FutureWarning: Adding 'defaults' to channel list implicitly is deprecated and will be removed in 25.3. 

To remove this warning, please choose a default channel explicitly with conda's regular configuration system, e.g. by adding 'defaults' to the list of channels:

  conda config --add channels defaults
